		<h1>Final Project Summary</h1>

			<h2>Topic and purpuse</h2>
			<p>My final project is my personal website to showcase my experience, projects, skills, and contact information. It should be concise and clear so that the recruiters can easily know me and want to hire me. I want more people to know about me from this website.</p>

		<div class = "chunk">
			<h2>iframe</h2>
			<p>I used iframe to show the demo video of my project Trojan Expedition on the Project page</p>

		<div class = "chunk">
			<h2> jQuery Plugin</h2>
			<p>I used jQuery Plugin to make the terminal style contact form in my Contact page. The website is here: https://www.jqueryscript.net/form/terminal-contact.html You can see lots of codes in the style tag. I didn't write them myself, and they are from the website. To distinguish them from my CSS stylesheet, I put them in the style tag. I have done the w3 validation check, and they work fine.</p>

		<div class = "chunk">
			<h2> Website icon</h2>
			<p>Also, I designed my personal icon: YZ. On the website tag, you can see it.</p>

			<h2> What I want to say</h2>
			<p>It is a pity that due to limited time, I did not implement many functions that I plan to do. I will do improvement during the winter. For the home page, I plan to use srollout JQuery to show more images and introductions of myself. I will add more experiences and projects to the webiste. Also, I will store the data input to the contact form. Right now, the data are not stored.</p>
